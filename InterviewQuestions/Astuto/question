1.  Title: Reachable Marble Counts
    Description:
    You are given an initial number of marbles N, and two operations that you can perform any number of times and in any order:

Remove A marbles from the jar.

Remove B marbles from the jar.

You can never have less than 1 marble in the jar. Your task is to return the total number of unique positive marble counts that can be reached starting from N, including N itself.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^4

1 <= A, B <= N

Input Format:
An integer N (initial marbles)

An integer A (marbles to remove in operation 1)

An integer B (marbles to remove in operation 2)

Output Format:
Return a single integer: the number of unique positive marble counts reachable.

Example 1:
Input:

ini
Copy
Edit
N = 4
A = 1
B = 2
Output:
4
Explanation: Possible values: 4 (initial), 3 (4 - 1), 2 (4 - 2), 1 (4 - 1 - 2)

Example 2:
Input:
N = 10
A = 3
B = 4
Output:
7
Explanation: Reachable values: 10, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1

3.  Test Case
    Input:
    N = 10  
    A = 3  
    B = 4  
    Expected Output:
    8

Explanation:
We start with 10 marbles and can subtract 3 or 4 at a time. The unique positive values we can get are:

10 (initial)

7 (10 - 3)

6 (10 - 4)

4 (10 - 3 - 3)

3 (10 - 3 - 4 or 10 - 4 - 3)

1 (10 - 3 - 3 - 3)

Also:

9 is not reachable

8 is not reachable

5 is not reachable

2 is not reachable

So the reachable unique values are: 10, 7, 6, 4, 3, 1

But you can also get:

10 - 4 - 4 = 2

10 - 4 - 4 - 3 = -1 (invalid)

10 - 3 - 3 - 4 = 0 (invalid)

Final set of valid positive values:
{10, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1}

Wait! Let's double-check:

10

10 - 3 = 7

10 - 4 = 6

7 - 3 = 4

7 - 4 = 3

6 - 3 = 3 (already counted)

6 - 4 = 2

4 - 3 = 1

3 - 3 = 0 (stop)

2 - 3 = -1 (stop)

1 - 3 = -2 (stop)

Final unique values: 10, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1

So expected output: 7

Corrected Expected Output: 7
