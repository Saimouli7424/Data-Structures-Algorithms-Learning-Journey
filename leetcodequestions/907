🧠 What left[i] and right[i] actually represent:
left[i] → how many subarrays ending at i in which arr[i] is the minimum

right[i] → how many subarrays starting at i in which arr[i] is the minimum

✅ Final Understanding:
You got the core idea correct:

left[i] → how many elements on the left side (including i) make arr[i] the min

right[i] → how many elements on the right side (including i) make arr[i] the min

Together → they give the count of subarrays where arr[i] is the minimum, and we multiply that with arr[i] for contribution.



for the example {3,1,2,4}:-
--------------------------
left={1,2,1,1}
right={1,3,2,1}

🧠 What does left[i] mean?
-----------------------------------------
👉 left[i] tells how many consecutive elements to the left of arr[i] (including itself) are strictly greater than or equal to arr[i].

We count until we find a smaller element (or reach the beginning).

💡 Input:
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]
Let’s go index-by-index:

✅ i = 0 → arr[0] = 3
No elements to the left.

So only itself counts.

left[0] = 1

✅ i = 1 → arr[1] = 1
We look left from index 1:

arr[0] = 3 → 3 > 1 ✅

No more elements left.

Count = 1 (3) + 1 (self) →
left[1] = 2

✅ i = 2 → arr[2] = 2
Look left from index 2:

arr[1] = 1 → 1 < 2 ❌ → stop
Only itself counts
left[2] = 1

✅ i = 3 → arr[3] = 4
Look left from index 3:

arr[2] = 2 → 2 < 4 ❌ → stop
Only itself counts
left[3] = 1

✅ Final left array:
left = [1, 2, 1, 1]
👀 What this means:
For 3 → only itself is min → 1 subarray

For 1 → in subarrays ending at 1 and including 3, 1 is smallest → 2 subarrays

For 2 → only itself

For 4 → only itself


🧠 What does right[i] mean?
-----------------------------------------
👉 right[i] tells how many consecutive elements to the right of arr[i] (including itself) are strictly greater than or equal to arr[i].

We count until we find a smaller element (or reach the end).

Given:
arr = [3, 1, 2, 4]
We compute right[] step by step:

✅ i = 0 → arr[0] = 3
Look right:

arr[1] = 1 → 1 < 3 ❌ → stop
Only itself
➡️ right[0] = 1

✅ i = 1 → arr[1] = 1
Look right:

arr[2] = 2 → 2 > 1 ✅

arr[3] = 4 → 4 > 1 ✅

no more → stop

So: (arr[2], arr[3]) + self = 3 elements
➡️ right[1] = 3

✅ i = 2 → arr[2] = 2
Look right:

arr[3] = 4 → 4 > 2 ✅

no more → stop

Self + 1 = 2
➡️ right[2] = 2

✅ i = 3 → arr[3] = 4
No elements on the right → only itself
➡️ right[3] = 1

✅ Final right array:
right = [1, 3, 2, 1]
👀 What this means:
i	arr[i]	right[i]	Explanation
0	3	1	Only itself, next is 1 which is smaller ❌
1	1	3	1 is smaller than 2, 4 → all included
2	2	2	2 and 4 only, stop at end
3	4	1	Only itself, no right element
Let me know if you want to see the full formula applied now using left[i] * right[i] * arr[i] to get the final answer step-by-step!







You said:
in the left side for 2 is smaller than itself 2 and 3 but why you considered only 1 time it has to come 2times or else you are considering in the sense of subarrays

Awesome question! 😎 You're thinking deeply now — let's clarify this carefully and clearly explain why left[2] = 1 for arr = [3, 1, 2, 4].

🎯 First, a recap:
We are calculating left[i] to find how many subarrays ending at i in which arr[i] is the minimum element.

🔍 At i = 2, arr[2] = 2:
We look left and ask:

"How far back can we go where all elements are greater than or equal to 2?"

Let’s see:

arr[1] = 1 → ❌ 1 < 2 → stop here

So:

Only arr[2] = 2 itself is included

We can't go further because a smaller element (1) is blocking us

🧠 So, why is left[2] = 1?
Because:

The subarrays ending at index 2 are:

[2]

[1, 2]

[3, 1, 2]

Now ask: In which of these is 2 the minimum?

✅ Only in [2], it's the minimum
❌ In [1, 2] and [3, 1, 2], the minimum is 1

Hence, only 1 subarray exists where 2 is the minimum →
👉 left[2] = 1

🔄 We're not counting duplicates of the number itself — we’re counting how many elements to the left (including itself) are ≥ arr[i] before we hit a smaller one.
This ensures we only count valid ranges where arr[i] is the minimum.

Let me know if you'd like to break this down visually with stack operations too!
