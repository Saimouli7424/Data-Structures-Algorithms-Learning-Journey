monotonic stack:-
used to maintain either decreasing order or increasing order

best example is next greater element

given ex:-arr = [2, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
		 0  1  2  3  4  5
**now come from backward to maintain monotonic stack(ascending order ->from top to bottom) or (descending order ->from bottom to top)

1)initially 4 no next greater element stack =4 at index 5=-1; 
2)next element is 6, in stack 4 is less than 6 so pop 4 and insert 6 index 4=-1;

3)next element is 3, in stack =6 so 3<6 push 3 in stack and index 3=6;

4)next element is 5, in stack at top is 3<5 pop 3 and 6>5 so at index 2=6 push 5

5)next element is 1, in stack at top is 5>1 so at index 1=5 push 1

6)next element is 2, in stack at top is 2>1 so pop 1 and now top is 5>2 so at index 0=5
